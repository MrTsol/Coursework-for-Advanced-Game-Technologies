# Coursework-for-Advanced-Game-Technologies

The task was to create a golf game from scratch using the physics engine that was provided by the Newcastle University and which also has been made by us throughout the lectures and tutorials.

Above for simplicity reasons i have uploaded only the game's main code written by me. Ofcourse there is a lot background code (physics/a.i etc.).
