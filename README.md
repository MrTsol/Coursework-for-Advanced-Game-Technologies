# Coursework-for-Advanced-Game-Technologies

The task was to create a golf game from scratch using the physics engine that was provided by the Newcastle University and which also has been made by us throughout the lectures and tutorials.

Some of the main features of the game are:
  •	All short of physics we did throughout the tutorials
  •	Broad phase
  •	Constrains
  •	Sphere to AABB
  •	AABB to AABB
  •	Sphere to OBB (moving walls)
  •	AI – State Machine (moving walls)
  •	AI – Pathfinding (robot)
  •	Collisions (doors to levels, walls, robot, winning areas)
